        <h3 class="mb-4">1. Subscription Cancellation</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          You can cancel your Viewora subscription at any time through your account dashboard. You must cancel your subscription before your next billing cycle begins to avoid being charged for the subsequent period.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">2. Access After Cancellation</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your account and published virtual tours until the end of your current billing period. After this period, your account will be downgraded to a dormant state, and your public virtual tours will become inactive.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">3. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Viewora operates on a strict no-refund policy. <strong>Subscription fees are non-refundable once billed.</strong> We do not provide partial refunds or credits for partially used billing periods (e.g., if you cancel halfway through a month).
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">4. Exceptions</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          We may, at our sole discretion, issue a refund or credit in exceptional circumstances, or if required by applicable Kenyan consumer protection laws. If you believe you have been charged in error, please contact us immediately at support@viewora.com.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-4">5. Free Trials</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">
          If you sign up for a free trial, your payment method will not be charged until the trial period ends. You will be automatically enrolled in your chosen subscription plan at the end of the trial unless you cancel beforehand.
