          We are Viewora. We believe that finding a home, booking a stay, or investing in property should be a transparent and immersive experience.

          <h2 class="mb-4">The Market Problem</h2>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4 text-lg">
            For decades, the real estate and hospitality industries have relied on static images to sell physical spaces. But photos are fundamentally limited. They can be manipulated with clever angles, wide lenses, and heavy editing—creating a mismatch between expectation and reality.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted text-lg">
            This lack of transparency leads to wasted physical viewings for real estate agents, disappointed guests for Airbnb hosts, and longer sales cycles for property developers. Buyers and renters want to know <em>exactly</em> what a space feels like before committing their time or money.

          <h2 class="mb-4">Why Viewora Exists</h2>
          <p class="text-muted mb-4 text-lg">
            Viewora was founded in Kenya to solve this problem globally. We recognized that while enterprise-grade virtual tour software existed, it was often prohibitively expensive, required specialized hardware, and involved steep learning curves.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted text-lg">
            We built Viewora to democratize spatial marketing. Our mission is to provide an accessible, powerful, and intuitive SaaS platform that empowers any property professional—from a single-property Airbnb host to a national real estate agency—to create and share immersive 360° virtual tours.
