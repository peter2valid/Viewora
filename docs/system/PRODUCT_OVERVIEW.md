# Product Overview

**Viewora Dashboard** is a SaaS application that allows users to create, manage, and publish 360° virtual tours. It transforms equirectangular panoramic images into interactive, web-based 3D experiences.

## Core Features
1. **Space Management:** Users can create "Spaces" (projects or tours).
2. **Scene Uploads:** Users can upload equirectangular JPEG/PNG images to a Supabase storage bucket.
3. **Editor Engine:** A Marzipano-powered WebGL viewer where users can preview their 360° scenes, place hotspots, and link scenes together.
4. **Publishing:** Spaces can be published, generating a public URL (`/tours/:slug`) that displays the tour read-only without requiring authentication.

## Target Audience
Real estate agents, hospitality businesses, automotive dealerships, and anyone needing to present physical locations virtually.
